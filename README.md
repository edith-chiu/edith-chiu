## Hello I am Edith Chiu.

<!--
**edith-chiu/edith-chiu** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am an adaptable and driven data analytics professional with newly developed technical skills in Python, SQL, Power BI, and data visualisation, gained through the Generation UK Data Analytics Programme. During the course, I built hands-on experience cleaning, analysing, and interpreting large datasets, and transforming insights into clear, actionable findings that support decision-making.

With a background spanning transport operations, customer-facing environments, hospitality, HR support, and marketing, I bring a strong foundation of transferable skills essential to data work—precision, problem-solving, operational accuracy, workflow optimisation, and the ability to stay calm and analytical under pressure. My previous roles strengthened my attention to detail, performance tracking, frontline communication, and ability to work efficiently in fast-paced, high-volume environments.

I am a quick learner who enjoys working with complex information and continuously improving my skills. I’m now eager to apply my analytical mindset, technical capabilities, and dedication to high standards to a forward-thinking organisation where I can contribute meaningful insights and grow as a Data Analyst.
